\section{Conclusions}

\section{Recommended future research}
The conclusions made and work presented in this dissertation opens a few avenues for further improvement and research.
\subsection{Systematic constraint handling}
At present the proposed method of systematic constraint handling consists only of routines to do calculations and support only a small subset of possible models.
The following would be attractive additions to the method;
\begin{itemize}
  \item Support for more model types.
  \item A graphical user interface to bind all the routines into an easily accessible tool.
  \item Data representation
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Constraint set fitting}
\subsection{The Operability Index}

\section{Conclusions}
Form the proposed method of systematic constraint handling, the following conclusions can be made;
\begin{itemize}
  \item Specification of unrealistic constraints lead to a low Operability Index and unattainable expectations of both the inputs and outputs of the process.
  \item Checking constraints via the process model can identify constraint sets that are not attainable. Also, checking changes to constraints via the process model allows for a measure of clamping to be determined.
  \item Fitting a constraint set within the AOS leads to operating regions that are completely feasible in both the input and output space.
  \item Constraints that are linear combinations of variables can be applied to a system by adding a pseudo-variable to the process and imposing high/low constraint thereon.
  \item The results obtained by the method are readily applicable to commercial MPCs.
\end{itemize}

From the process of fitting constraint sets, these additional conclusions can be made;
\begin{itemize}
\item The size of a constraint set can be reduced by fitting a smaller set within, whilst maximising the operating region of the fitted set.
\item A more rigorous formulation is obtained when the optimisation problem is expressed in terms of facets rather than vertices, but this increases the solution complexity.
\item The constrained problem formulation resulted in faster solution times when compared to the unconstrained case.
\item The accuracy of fitting for arbitrary sets yielded the following results;
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 80\% of fitting results were within 10\% of the optimum solution for set fitting in 2 dimensions.
  \item 1\% of fitting results were within 10\% of the optimum solution for set fitting in 3 dimensions.
  This low accuracy is ascribed to ill conditioning of the problem and increased superfluous degrees of freedom.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommended future research}
The conclusions made and work presented in this dissertation opens a few avenues for further improvement and research.
\subsection{Systematic constraint handling}
At present the proposed method of systematic constraint handling consists only of routines to do calculations and support only a small subset of possible models.
The following would be attractive additions to the method;
\begin{itemize}
  \item Support for more model types.
  \item A graphical user interface to bind all the routines into an easily accessible tool.
  \item An improved method of data representation for higher order systems, as graphical representation becomes difficult in more than 3 dimensions. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Constraint set fitting}
The process of constraint set fitting should be improved upon to increase its accuracy for higher dimensional systems.

Also, the incorporation of additional functions into the fitting procedure would improve the output of this process.
Fitting done with respect to the volume integral of (for example) economic/sensitivity functions would highlight regions of economic/control concern.

\subsection{The Operability Index}
Whilst not strictly speaking part of this project, an extension of the Operability Index and its associated spaces are proposed.
The inclusion of dynamics in the models should produce a transient space around the original AOS.
The information obtained from this space could be valuable in determining optimal/realistic dynamic constraints for MPC packages, e.g. the funnels of RMPCT.

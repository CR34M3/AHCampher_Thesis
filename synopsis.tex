The handling of constraints for multivariable predictive controllers (MPCs)
forms the basis of their control algorithm and largely affects the performance
of these controllers. A method to determine realistic constraints, based more
on the process model than process knowledge, would therefore be an attractive
addition to commercial MPC packages.

A systematic method of determining constraints and interactively changing them
was developed. The operability index, as defined by \citet{vinsonartoi}, was
used as the basis for the design. Focus was placed on making the method
rigorous (with regards to the use of the process model), creating an interactive
environment in which to manipulate the constraints and ensuring compatibility
of the outputs with commercial MPC packages.

For testing purposes, Honeywell's RMPCT$^{\copyright}$ and AspenTech's 
DMCPlus$^{\copyright}$ was used in conjunction with the developed software. Case 
studies form Anglo Platinum as well as the Tennessee Eastman sample problem was
used to test functionality and performance of the method.

\section{Case studies}
To test the method of systematic constraint handling proposed in chapter~\ref{chap:conhand} the following physical systems were investigated.
Both rigs are from the Process Modelling and Control laboratory of the University of Pretoria.

\subsection{Level and flow rig}
\subsubsection{System description}
The level and flow rig consists of two control valves, a measured flow (to one control valve) and a measured level.
Figure~\ref{fig:flowphoto} shows a photograph of the rig along with its process flow diagram.

  \caption[Level and flow rig photograph and flow diagram]{Level and flow rig photograph (left) and process flow diagram (right).}
  \label{fig:flowphoto}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Process model}
This rig is modelled as a $2\times2$ system.
The MVs are the milliamp signals sent to the valves ($x_1\text{ \& }x_2$) and correspond to the fractional openings of the two valves.
The CVs are the flow ($F$) and the level ($L$).
The steady-state gain matrix of this process ($G_{fl}$) is shown in equation~\ref{eq:flowmodel}.
Note that action of valve 1 is air-to-open and valve 2 is air-to-close valve, which explains the signs of the gains in the first column of $G_{fl}$.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:flowmodel}
                    %x1       x2
    G_{fl} = \bpm -0.0476 & -0.0498 \\      %L
                  0.0111 & -0.0604 \\ \epm %F
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Operating conditions}
The operating conditions for this rig are shown in table~\ref{tab:flowopcon}
The nominal operating point (output space) is; 1.322 gpm ($F$) and 16.4048 cm ($L$).

  \begin{tabular}{llllll}
    \toprule

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Laboratory distillation column}
\subsubsection{System description}
The second case study investigated is a 10-plate distillation column.
The column is run as a closed system with bottoms and distillate being mixed and fed back into the column.
Figure~\ref{fig:columnphoto} shows a photograph of the column along with its process flow diagram.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=7.4cm]{graph/columnphoto.jpg}

    \scalebox{1}{\input{graph/columnpfd}}  
  \caption[Laboratory distillation column photograph and flow diagram]{Laboratory distillation column photograph (left) and flow diagram (right).}
  \label{fig:columnphoto}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{System model}
The process model has been reduced to a $2\times2$ matrix.
Reflux flowrate ($R$, expressed as a milliamp value sent to the valve) and the setpoint of plate 10's temperature ($T_{10~sp}$) are the MVs.
The temperatures of plate 1 and 8 ($T_1\text{ \& }T_{8}$) are the CVs.
Figure~\ref{fig:columnmodel} shows a graphic representation of the column model and equation~\ref{eq:columnmodel} gives the values for the steady-state gain model.
The nominal operating point (output space) is; 68~\textcelsius ($T_1$) and 78~\textcelsius ($T_8$).
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:columnmodel}
                 % R      T10sp
  G_{col} = \bpm -0.0575 & 0.96 \\       % T1
                -0.146  & 0.518 \\ \epm % T8
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
%    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{graph/columnmodel}
    \scalebox{1}{\input{graph/columnmodel}}  
  \caption[Column model]{Column model showing internal PI controller.}
  \label{fig:columnmodel}
\end{figure}

The PI controller between $T_{10~sp}$ and $Q$ is contained in the process' baselayer. 
This was added as a safety measure, should the advanced control layer fail.

\subsubsection{Operating conditions}
Table~\ref{tab:columnopcon} shows the operating conditions of the distillation column.

    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Variable} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Operational constraints} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Physical constraints} \\
    && Low & High & Low & High \\ 
    \midrule
    Inputs &$R~(\text{mA})$          & 11 & 15 & 4 & 20 \\
           &$T_{10~sp}~(\textcelsius)$ & 78 & 82 & 0 & 90 \\[1.3ex]
    Outputs &$T_1~(\textcelsius)$     & 66 & 68 & 15 & 68 \\
            &$T_{8}~(\textcelsius)$   & 78 & 82 & 25 & 90 \\
    \bottomrule

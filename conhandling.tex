\section{Interactivity}
\citet{vinsonphd} presents a list of issues that limit the performace of MPCs
(with specific attention to DMCplus) and proposes methods (using the 
operability index) to solve these problems. Most of these methods are directly
applicable to the proposed contraint handling method of this document. The
issues identified by \citet{vinsonphd} as well as additions are shown in table
\ref{tab:mpcissues}.

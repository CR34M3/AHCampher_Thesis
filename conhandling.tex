\section{Interactivity}
\citet{vinsonphd} presents a list of issues that limit the performance of MPCs (with specific attention to DMCplus) and proposes methods (using the operability index) to solve these problems. 
Most of these methods are directly applicable to the proposed constraint handling method of this document. 
The issues identified by \citet{vinsonphd} as well as additions are shown in table~\ref{tab:mpcissues}.

    Issues hampering MPC potential & Current solution & Proposed solution \\
    \midrule
Processes with considerable noise cause targets to move with each controller execution.
& Limit MV stepsize or filter CVs. 
Both of these have a stabilizing effect but result in a more sluggish controller. 
These limits may also cause the controller to not reach optimum solutions.
& Using the OI and the associated output spaces, the possible outputs of a (newly) limited input space is clearly shown.\\[1.3ex]
    
Constraints on MV can cause CVs to not reach their maximum/minimum constraints. 
These CV constraints usually correspond with economically optimal solutions. 
& Increase/Adjust the MV limits. 
& The spaces associated with the OI would make it clear to what extent MV limits can be adjusted and how they would affect the output space.\\[1.3ex]

Disturbances can cause CVs to violate constraints. 
In some cases, the controller might give up on a constraint and continue (now using a subset of the CVs).
& Possible solutions include; model re-identification (in the case of an inconsistency), fixing the source of the disturbance or adding a DV to account for the disturbance.
& Due to the fixed constraints on MVs and CVs the resulting AIS and DOS can be used to calculate the controller's ability to reject a disturbance. 
A measure of controller robustness can be derived from this.\\[1.3ex]
    
Move Suppression factors for MVs and Equal Concern Errors (give-ups) for CVs are used to tune MPCs for dynamic performance.
& The choice of these factors are usually qualitative and according to guidelines (and validated via offline simulations).
& The OI (and its associated spaces) can provide guidance in determining move suppression factors and give-ups. 
The difficulty in controlling a CV at a given constraint can be derived from the OI. 
How far a CV constraint can be moved (given the MV constraints) can also be determined from the OI.\\

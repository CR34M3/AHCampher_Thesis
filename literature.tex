\section{Model Predictive Control}\label{sec:mpclit}
Since its successful implementation in the petrochemical industry, model predictive control (MPC) has gained widespread acceptance in the processing sector \citep[1]{maciejowskimpc}. 
This has led to the development of many commercial MPC packages such as DMCplus (Aspentech), RMPCT (Honeywell), Connoisseur (Invensys) and SMOC (Shell Global Solutions) \citep{qinbadgwell}.
\subsection{Control theory}
Model predictive control differs from other model based control techniques (such  as Inverse Nyquist Array- and Internal Model Control) in its active use of predictions for future process outcomes \citep[137]{maciejowskifb}. 
In this context, MPC further distinguishes itself from other predictive control techniques in its ability to accommodate constraints on inputs and outputs.

\citet[8]{maciejowskimpc} summarises the control methodology of MPC in four steps; Measure, Predict, Optimize/Calculate and Apply. 
Along with figure~\ref{fig:mpc:general} these steps are summarized below;
%TODO - add symbols to list
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Measure; the current outputs are measured and the error (deviation from the set-point trajectory) is calculated.
  \item Predict; using the model, future outputs are calculated (over the prediction horizon).
  \item Optimize/Calculate; control moves (over the control horizon) are now calculated to minimize the predicted deviation from the set-point trajectory.
  \item Apply; only the first control move is implemented, where-after this procedure is restarted.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Objective functions}
Optimal control moves are determined by means of objective functions.
These functions are often referred to as cost functions \citep[41]{maciejowskimpc} as they can incorporate input/output weighting based on economic factors.

The general formulation of the unconstrained objective function is presented in equation~\ref{eq:genobjfn}. 
Modifications to this function (due to constraints) is discussed in section~\ref{sec:conobjfn}. 
From \citet[17]{rawlings} and \citet[41]{maciejowskimpc}, the objective function which penalizes deviations from the set-point trajectory as well as moves in the inputs is shown below;
% TODO - eqn in terms of zero setpoint, generalize to non-zero sp
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:genobjfn}
  V(x(0),{\bf u})=\frac{1}{2}\sum^{N-1}_{k=0}[x(k)'Qx(k)+u(k)'Ru(k)]
  + \frac{1}{2}x(N)'P_fx(N)
\end{equation}
It is clear that the objective function depends on both the state sequence and the input sequence. 
The current state, $x(0)$ is known (measured) and the subsequent states are determined by the model and the input sequence. 
The optimal MPC control problem therefore becomes;
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:opctrlprob}
  \min_{\bf u} V(x(0),{\bf u})
\end{equation}

\subsection{Tuning}
As far as the objective function (equation~\ref{eq:genobjfn}) is concerned, the most prominent tuning parameters for MPC is the weighting matrices $Q$, $R$ and $P_f$. 
These are used to enforce the relative importance of deviations in both the inputs and outputs.

The weighting matrices are by no means the only tuning parameters for MPCs; additional parameters include the horizons used for predictions, the reference trajectory and the auxiliary models used (e.g. disturbance models). 
Chapter 7 of \citet{maciejowskimpc} covers the tuning of MPCs in some detail.

\section{Constraints in MPC}
When used in conjunction with a steady-state optimizer, MPCs are able to operate with more CVs than MVs \citet{vinsonphd}. 
Control of the CVs are now within ranges rather than on set-points.

\section{Process Operability}
The method of constraint handling, as presented in this document, stems largely from work done by Georgakis and colleagues, in particular \citet{vinsonphd}, \citet{vinsonartoi}, \citet{limaphd}, \citet{opconproc} and \citet{opidealrx}. 
To place the operability index of \citet{vinsonphd} (defined in section \ref{sec:oi}) in context, a short overview of the most common process operability techniques is presented below.
\subsection{Overview}
The subject of process operability is an ongoing field of study with many of the methods available being qualitative \citep[164]{skogestad}. 
A distinction is made between steady-state and dynamic operability methods. 
Whereas the later considers dynamic criteria, steady-state operability measures evaluate the relationship of process inputs and outputs at steady-state only.
\subsubsection{Steady-state operability measures}
The relative gain array (RGA) is one of the most used operability measures \citep[576]{luyben} and relates input/output interactivity.
Each element in the RGA ($\beta_{ij}$) is defined as the ratio of the steady-state gain ratios between input, $i$, and output, $j$, when all other inputs are constant and when all other outputs are constant.
\citet{artrdg} defined the RDG, which expanded on the RGA to include the effect of disturbances. 
Noting that the values of the RGA can be ``misleading'' \citep[87]{skogestad}, the use of norms such as the RGA-number are preferred.

The Niederlinski index is another measure that uses only steady-state gains of the process model \citep[572-573]{luyben}. 
This index is considered necessary but not sufficient, as positive values of the Niederlinski are inconclusive to the stability of the system \citep[445]{skogestad}.

Singular value decomposition stems from the use of eigenvalues as an operability measure. 
The use of singular values are preferred as eigenvalues are a poor
measure of gain and can often be misleading \citep[75]{skogestad}.
Maximum and minimum singular values are mostly used to select controlled variables but can also be used as a performance measure along with the condition number (\citet[596]{luyben}, \citet[80-82]{skogestad}).

\subsubsection{Dynamic operability measures}
The RGA can be expanded to contain frequency-dependant terms and is often referred to as the dynamic relative gain array (DRGA) \citep[637]{marlin}. 
The RDG \citep{artrdg} can be expanded in a similar way to include frequency-dependant terms.

Nyquist array methods as defined by Rosenbrock, as quoted by \citet[92]{skogestad}, are an extension of the SISO Nyquist stability criteria that include frequency dynamics. 
The two methods developed are the direct Nyquist array and the inverse Nyquist array. 
When used in conjunction with Gershgorin bands, conditions for overall stability can be derived \citep[440]{skogestad}.

\citet{vinsonphd} lists other dynamic operability measures which rely on the choice of a controller type. Further shortcomings of the above mentioned operability measures are also discussed in that text. 

\subsection{Operability Index}\label{sec:oi}
The operability index was defined by \citet{vinsonphd} as a measure of steady-state process operability. 
Constraint interdependence is used as the basis of this index. 
Further work by \citet{limaphd} expanded this index to cover non-square systems and some application to dynamic systems.

\subsubsection{Definitions}
The operability index focuses on input-output relationships rather the system's dynamic states \citep{vinsonphd}. 
Input and output values are defined by 'spaces' (in $R^n$). 
These spaces are the 'feasible regions' which are bounded by the inequalities describing the ranges of the inputs or outputs. 
The following spaces are of interest;
\begin{itemize}
  \item Available Input Space (AIS); the set of values that process      inputs can take. 
    The limits on these values are based on both physical limits (e.g.     valve openings) or process design values (e.g. flow-rates or temperatures). 
Figure \ref{fig:sampleais} illustrates an AIS for two variables ($u_1, u_2$) bounded by simple high/low limits.
  \item Achievable Output Space (AOS); this is the set of values which the process outputs can obtain, given the AIS. 
The AIS maps to the AOS by means of a process model, $G$. 
Therefore, a point $u$ in the AIS corresponds to a point $y$ in the AOS via $y=G(u)$. 
Examples of AOSs for linear and non-linear models are shown in figure \ref{fig:sampleaos}.
  \item Desired Output Space (DOS); this represents the desired output values of the process. 
These values are typically based on operational and financial   parameters. 
Figure \ref{fig:sampledos} shows a sample DOS for a two output    system.
  \item Expected Disturbance Space (EDS); all the values of the expected disturbances to the system. 
In the case of linear models, these values are translated back to the input space by means of a disturbance model, $G_d$.
  \item Desired Input Space (DIS); in the same manner that the AIS maps to the AOS, the DIS represents combined reverse mappings of the DOS and EDS.
The DIS is calculated as the inputs, $u$, that satisfy the model, ie. $y=G(u,d)$ (with $y$ and $d$ from the DOS and EDS respectively).
Figure \ref{fig:sampledis} shows this combined translation.
\end{itemize}

\citet{vinsonphd} proceeds to define the generalised Output Operability Index (OOI) as shown in equation \ref{eq:genooi}. 
Where $\mu$ represents a function to calculate the volume of a space.
From this definition it is clear that the controlability of a process decreases if the DIS does not cover the whole AIS. 
Servo- and regulatory operability indices are also defined in the text, but are not shown here.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:genooi}
     OOI = \frac{\mu(AIS\cap DIS)}{\mu(DIS)}
\end{equation}

All the concepts above are directly applicable to square systems.
For the case of non-square systems (more outputs than inputs) the operability index formulation is extended to interval operability. 
In this case, process outputs are split into two categories; setpoint controlled variables and range controlled variables.
The first being controlled on a given setpoint, whereas the later is allowed to vary within its given maximum and minimum limits.

\citet{limaphd} elaborates on the interval operability of linear non-square systems and defines the following concepts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The interval AOS (AOS$_I$); which is the union of all AOS($d$) where is within the EDS. 
This is typically generated by the shifting of AOS($d=0$) in the directions determined by $G_d$ (the disturbance model).
  \item The Achievable Output Interval Set (AOIS); defined as a rectangle with the same aspect ratio as the DOS, bound by the lines (or hyperplanes) that correspond to the minimum and maximum values of $d$ in the AOS. 
Noting that the issue of interval operability is being addressed, the AOIS does not need to be strictly contained within the AOS$_I$.
\end{itemize}
The thesis of \citet{limaphd} proceeds to define a hyper-volume ratio (HVR) as shown in equation \ref{eq:hvr}. 
The aim being here to define a measure for obtaining tighter control on CVs by reducing the size of the DOS (without causing infeasibilities). 
The process remains interval controllable as long as the AOIS remains a subset of the DOS (AOIS$\subseteq$DOS).
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hvr}
    HVR = \frac{\mu(DOS)}{\mu(AOIS)}
\end{equation}
To change the relative importance (tightness of control) on variables, weights are imposed on the AOIS. 
This in turn affects the aspect ratio of the AOIS.

\citet{limaphd} proposes two methods to calculate an AOIS for higher dimensional systems; an iterative method and a method based on linear programming. 
In both cases, this corresponds to the tightest set of output constraints which still render the system controllable. 
Both methods are briefly discussed below;
\begin{itemize}
  \item Iterative approach; this method relies on the use of computational geometry tools to calculate convex hulls and intersections. 
An AOIS is initially estimated and expanded until it intersects the extreme subsets of the AOS. 
The magnitude by which the AOIS is increased is calculated using the Secant and bisection method. 
The calculations contained in this method are computationally intensive and limit its use to systems of 8 dimensions and lower.
  \item LP approach; in this approach the constraints and objective function are reformulated as linear functions. 
The extreme subsets of the AOS are expressed as linear inequalities and objective function set up as to determine the common intersection point of the AOIS and a given extreme subset. 
The proposed LP approach overcomes the computational intensity of the iterative method and is suitable for online calculation of the AOIS.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Application}
Numerous authors have illustrated the application of the operability index (OI). 
\citet{opconproc} focus on a general application of the OI, emphasising its ability to identify inoperable processes without the need to specify a controller structure. 
\citet{opidealrx} applies the OI to the design of ideal reactors. 
The analysis of a vinyl acetate reactor produced interesting results
regarding the mapping of the AIS to the AOS. 
It was shown that for certain classes of non-linear systems, the AIS boundaries do not map to the boundaries of the AOS.

Although the  operability index can be used with square or non-square, linear or non-linear models, its easiest application is to linear models. 
This is advantageous as most of the current MPCs use linear models \citep{vinsonphd}.

\citet{vinsonphd} highlights some properties of MPC (in particular DMCplus) which lends themselves to the  application of the operability index.
Table~\ref{tab:mpcoi} summarises these properties and applications.

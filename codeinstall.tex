\section{Installation notes}

\subsection{Operating systems}
The routines for this project was developed in Linux (Ubuntu 10.04) and this is the only supported operating system.
The code has been run on Apple Mac, but instructions for this is not included in this document.

\subsection{Dependencies}
The code was developed using Python 2.6 and should be compatible with subsequent versions.
In addition to the base Python modles, NumPy and SciPy are required for calculations.
Subprocess calls in conjunctions with the qhull binaries are utilised, which requires both the qhull libraries and binaries to be installed.

Table \ref{tab:installs} lists the packages that need to be installed on Ubuntu.
These can be installed from the command line using \texttt{sudo apt-get install {\it[package name]}}.
